  # Generating idea for a future application
  idea:
    prompt: |
      Provide an idea for a console app on python.
    description: 'Suggests ideas for new applications.'

  # Make structure for code
  structure:
    prompt: |
      Give me a list of 5-10 files for app we discussed before. Print a path without '/' on the start and with '/' in the end and file name without any '/'. Do also main file. 
      Make all paths from main file path of project, don't use application name. Do not use images, html files etc. Only Python files.
      But don't forget about 'package.json', '.gitignore', 'README.md', '.env.example', 'LICENSE' files in the root of the project.
      Start with files that do not depend on others. For example, main.py depends on all files, so it should be at the end.
      Use clean architecture for console app.
