# KeepGit 𝌊

KeepGit is a Python script that generates code daily, saving it in a specified folder to maintain active contributions and GitHub statistics. Initially, this project was inspired by a personal desire to keep a steady GitHub contribution streak, but it quickly evolved into a full-fledged project with automation potential.

> This project also inspired the development of a new solution – **AI Developer**, a Go-based tool for rapid MVP development, designed to help startups automate their project building processes. More on this below.
